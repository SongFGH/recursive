class RecursiveCell(object):
  """Abstract object representing an recursive cell.

  An recursive cell, in the most abstract setting, is anything that has
  a state -- a vector of floats of size self.state_size -- and performs some
  operation that takes inputs of size self.input_size. This operation
  results in an output of size self.output_size and a new state.

  This module provides a number of basic commonly used recursive cells, such as
  LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and a number
  of operators that allow add dropouts, projections, or embeddings for inputs.
  Constructing multi-layer cells is supported by a super-class, MultiRNNCell,
  defined later. Every RNNCell must have the properties below and and
  implement __call__ with the following signature.
